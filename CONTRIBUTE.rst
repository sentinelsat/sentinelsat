Welcome to the ``sentinelsat`` open source project. We invite anyone to participate by contributing code, reporting bugs, fixing bugs, writing documentation and tutorials and discussing the future of this project.


Issue Conventions
=================

Please search existing issues, open and closed, before creating a new one.

Providing a Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example (`SSCCE <http://sscce.org/>`_) demonstrating the issue is encouraged.

``sentinelsat`` is not ``v1.0``. There may be backwards incompatible changes which you can find in the changelog (`CHANGELOG.rst <https://github.com/sentinelsat/sentinelsat/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst>`_). We invite you to propose changes and features you would like to see in ``v1.0``.


Design Principles
=================

- ``sentinelsat`` is meant to be a Pythonic client to the `Copernicus Open Access Hub <https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus>`_ and other manifestations of  the `Data Hub System (DHuS) <http://sentineldatahub.github.io/DataHubSystem>`_.
- ``sentinelsat`` should interface the functions of DHuS where possible, rather than replicating them in Python.
- all code must be Python 3 compliant but we strive for backwards compatibility with Python 2 where possible

Contributing
============

If you want to contribute code or documentation the proposed way is:

1. `Fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_ the repository.
2. Create a `branch <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/>`_ and make your changes in it.
3. Create a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/>`_.

If you plan on introducing major changes it is a good idea to create an issue first and discuss these changes with other contributors.

Code Conventions
================

``sentinelsat`` supports Python 2 and Python 3 in the same code base.

We strongly prefer code adhering to `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.

Tests are mandatory for new features. We use `pytest <https://pytest.org>`_ and `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`_.
All unit tests must use prerecorded responses to Copernicus Open Access Hub. We use `VCR.py <https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy>`_ to record the responses.
We aspire to 100% coverage but regard meaningful tests to be more important than reaching this goal. Test coverage is tracked with `Codecov <https://codecov.io/gh/sentinelsat/sentinelsat>`_.

We keep a changelog (`CHANGELOG.rst <https://github.com/sentinelsat/sentinelsat/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst>`_) following the `keepachangelog <http://keepachangelog.com>`_ template.

Good documentation is important to us. We use `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ and host the documentation at `sentinelsat.readthedocs.io <https://sentinelsat.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_.
All public functions should have docstrings. We use the `numpy docstring standard <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt#docstring-standard>`_.

Development Environment
=======================

We prefer developing with the most recent version of Python. ``sentinelsat`` currently supports Python 2.7 and all versions after 3.4.

Initial Setup
-------------

First, clone ``sentinelsat``'s ``git`` repo:

.. code-block:: console

  git clone https://github.com/sentinelsat/sentinelsat


Development should occur within a `virtual environment <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_ (venv, conda, etc.) to better isolate development work from your regular Python environments.

Installing sentinelsat
----------------------

``sentinelsat`` and its dependencies can be installed with ``pip``. Specifying the ``[dev]`` extra in the command below tells
``pip`` to also install ``sentinelsat``'s dev dependencies.

.. code-block:: console

  cd sentinelsat/
  pip install -e .[dev]


Running the tests
-----------------

``sentinelsat``'s tests are located in ``/tests``.

To run the tests

.. code-block:: console

  py.test -v


By default, prerecorded responses to Copernicus Open Access Hub queries are used to not be affected by its downtime.
Furthermore, any network accesses are blocked as well (by raising a ``pytest_socket.SocketBlockedError: A test tried to use socket.socket`` exception) to guarantee that all tests are indeed correctly covered by recorded queries.

To allow the tests to run actual queries against the Copernicus Open Access Hub set the environment variables and add ``--vcr disable`` to ``py.test`` arguments.

.. code-block:: console

  export DHUS_USER=<username>
  export DHUS_PASSWORD=<password>
  py.test -v --vcr disable


To update the recordings use:

.. code-block:: console

  py.test -v --vcr record_new


When you create a pull requests the tests will automatically run on `Travis <https://travis-ci.org/sentinelsat/sentinelsat>`_ and a coverage report will be created from `Codecov <https://codecov.io/gh/sentinelsat/sentinelsat>`_.

Versioning and Release
======================

``sentinelsat`` uses `semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>`_ from the ``v1.0`` release forward. Prior to that the versioning is ``0.Major.MinorAndPatch``.

Version numbers need to be adapted in sentinelsat/__init__.py as well as the Github compare link in the Readme.

Documentation is automatically built after each merge in the ``master`` branch using a webhook. The documentation landing page is set to ``stable``, which defaults to the latest release.

A new Zenodo DOI is created automatically with every Github release using the Zenodo webhook.

A new package is release on PyPi with the following commands.

.. code-block:: console

  pip install rstcheck twine
  rstcheck README.rst CONTRIBUTE.rst
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel --universal
  twine upload dist/*
