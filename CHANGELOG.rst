Change Log
==========

All notable changes to ``sentinelsat`` will be listed here.


[0.10] – 2017-xx-xx
-------------------

Added
~~~~~
* GeoJSON footprints are now allowed to contain just a single geometry instead of a feature
  collection. Any geometry type that has a WKT equivalent is now supported (rather than only
  Polygons).
* ``get_product_odata()`` can now be used to get the full metadata information available for a
  product if ``full=True`` is set.
* Added ``query_raw()`` that takes full text search string as input and returns a parsed
  dictionary just like the updated ``query()`` method.
* CLI: ``--sentinel=<int>`` option to select satellite (constellation)

Changed
~~~~~~~
* ``SentinelAPI``, etc. can now be directly imported from ``sentinelsat`` rather than
  ``sentinelsat.sentinel``.
* ``query()`` changes:

  - The ``area`` argument now expects a WKT string as input instead of a coordinate string.
    (Issue #101)
  - Date arguments can now be disabled by setting them to ``None`` and their values are now
    validated on the client side. (Issue #101)
  - The return value has been changed to a dict of dicts of parsed metadata values. One entry per
    product with the product ID as the key.

* ``download_all()`` expects a list of product IDs as input. This is compatible with the output of
  ``query()``.
* ``get_coordinates()`` has been replaced with functions ``read_geojson()`` and
  ``geojson_to_wkt()``. (Issue #101)

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~
* CLI: ``--sentinel1`` and ``--sentinel2`` will be removed with the next major release

Removed
~~~~~~~
* ``to_dict()`` has been removed since it is no longer required.
* ``load_query()`` has been made private (renamed to ``_load_query()``).


Fixed
~~~~~
* Fixed invalid GeoJSON output in both the CLI and API. (Issue #104)
* Fixed broken reporting of failed downloads in the CLI. (Issue #88)
* Attempting to download a product with an invalid ID no longer creates an infinite loop and a
  more informative error message is displayed in the CLI.

* ``KeyError('No results returned.')`` is no longer returned for zero returned products in a response.
* Renamed ``get_footprint`` to ``to_geojson`` and ``get_product_info`` to ``get_product_odata``.
